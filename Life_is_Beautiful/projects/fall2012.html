				<h2>Project1-Hog</h2>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>In this project, I developed a simulator and multiple strategies for
				the dice game Hog. I implemented some higher-order functions,
				experiment with random number generators, and generate some ASCII art.</p>
				<p> In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to reach 100 points first.  On
				each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. She
				scores the sum of the dice outcomes, unless any of the dice come up a 1 (Pig
				out), in which case she scores only 1 point for the turn.</p>
				<p>To spice up the game, we will play with three special rules:</p>
				<ol>
					<li> <b>Hog Tied</b>. If the sum of both players' scores ends in a seven
					(e.g., 17, 27, 57), then the current player can roll at most once.
					</li>
					<li> <b>Hog Wild</b>. If the sum of both players' scores is a multiple of
					seven (e.g., 14, 21, 35), then the current player rolls four-sided dice
					instead of the usual six-sided dice.
					</li>
					<li> <b>Free Bacon</b>. If a player chooses to roll zero dice, she scores
					one more than the tens digit of her opponent's score.  E.g., if the first
					player has 32 points, the second player can score four by rolling zero
					dice. If the opponent has fewer than 10 points (tens digit is zero), then the
					player scores one.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Project2-Twitter Trends</h2>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p> In this project, I developed a geographic visualization of twitter data
				across the USA. I used dictionaries, lists, and data abstraction
				techniques to create a modular program.</p>
				<p> The map displayed above depicts how the people in different states feel
				about Texas.  This image is generated by:</p>
				<ol>
					<li> Collecting public Twitter posts (tweets) that have been tagged with
					geographic locations and filtering for those that contain the "texas" query
					term,</li>
					<li> Assigning a sentiment (positive or negative) to each tweet, based on all
					of the words it contains,</li>
					<li> Aggregating tweets by the state with the closest geographic center, and finally</li>
					<li> Coloring each state according to the aggregate sentiment of its tweets.
					Red means positive sentiment; blue means negative.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Project3-Ants Vs. SomeBees</h2>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>In this project, I created a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tower_defense">tower
				defense</a> game called Ants Vs. SomeBees.  As the ant queen, I populated
				my colony with the bravest ants I can muster.  My ants must protect their
				queen from the evil bees that invade my territory.  Irritate the bees enough
				by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished.  Fail to pester the
				airborne intruders adequately, and my queen will succumb to the bees' wrath.
				This game is inspired by PopCap Games' <a href="http://www.popcap.com/games/pvz/web">Plants Vs. Zombies</a> ®.</p>
				<p>This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. The project
				also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program with many
				related parts.</p>

				<h2>Project4-A Scheme Interpreter</h2>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>In this project, I developed an interpreter for a subset of the
  				Scheme language.</p>
  				<p>I also implemented some small programs in Scheme. Scheme is a simple but
				powerful functional language. I found that much of what I have learned about
				Python transfers cleanly to Scheme as well as to other programming languages.</p>
